This is a Private Project and not intended for anybody to use but myself.
so i see no point in a privacy policy. 
no code will be hosted here. 
No private data used. 
Im just using github so i have a url i can point googles api service to.

Im just trying to access my own and noone elses sleep data stored through 'sleep as android' using google to authenticate with oauth2.
sadly i need a stupid website and privacy for my "service" which again i dont have because im not planning to make public or into a real product.
its just a personal tinker project for myself.
